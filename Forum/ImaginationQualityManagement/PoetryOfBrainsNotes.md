Preview of Ideas 

1. Brains are illogical.
2. All we know is an illusion created by our brains.     <br>
Sensing (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, etc.) is     <br>
impossible.The idea of neural representation,     <br>
stimulus/response, input/output, etc. is false.
3. Our illusion of reality is updated as we move our     <br>
bodies, provoking responses from reality that     <br>
impact our senses, which then pass/fails the     <br>
current illusion, causing the brain to keep it,     <br>
update it, or create a new one = learn.     <br>
4. To share experiences is impossible, but if we     <br>
move, test, act together we can force our brains to     <br>
create similar illusions of reality that feel like     <br>
shared experiences, and help us to create trust.     <br>

Brains are not logical.     <br> <br>

Brain activity is not like binary digits     <br>
that can be rendered into logic gates     <br>
and Boolean algebra (algebraic notation     <br>
for representing logical propositions).     <br>

Brain activity is instead rather     <br>
wicked looking, noisy, and trashy.     <br> <br>

Brains are dynamic systems that learn by testing,     <br>
acting, moving their bodies, etc.,     <br>
which Dr. Freeman will illustrate     <br>
in the next two examples.     <br> <br>

The first example comes from the work of     <br>
Jean Pierre Flourens (1794-1867)     <br>
French physiologist, founder of experimental     <br>
brain science, discoverer of chloroform anesthesia,     <br>
and more ...     <br> <br>

people Dr. Freeman gives credit to during his talk.</i>     <br> <br>

Hans-Lukas Teuber (1916-1977)     <br>
from MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology     <br>
Head of the Department of Psychology (1961-1977)     <br> <br>

Professor Teuber spoke about     <br>
his upside-down, prism-glasses experiment at     <br>
a symposium held in Poland in 1971:     <br> <br>

"In fact in one version of the basic experiment, two     <br> 
men are exposed to a normal environment wearing     <br>
identical prismatic spectacles; one walks actively     <br>
about while pushing the other over the same path     <br>
in a wheelchair. At the end of the hour the active     <br>
observer has almost fully adapted [functions normally],     <br>
whereas the passive observer has not adapted at all."     <br> <br>

functions." Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis (The     <br>
Polish neuroscience quarterly) 32.2 (1972): 615-656.     <br>
Retrieved 4/8/13 from ane.pl/pdf/3236.pdf     <br>

5 minutes 51 seconds<br><br>

The cortex of Professor Teuber's star student     <br>
learned to adapt to quick flips of the prism glasses,     <br>
allowing him to predict Cambridge traffic flipped     <br>
upside-down, right-side-up, upside-down, etc. as he     <br>
drove thru this traffic on a speeding motorcycle!     <br>

<br><hr>
6 minutes 39 seconds<br><br>

Brains learn by predicting what is going to happen     <br>
as a result of their own actions, actions that provoke     <br>
sensory input to pass/fail said predictions = learning.     <br> <br>

1) Brains imagine/predict the results of an action.     <br>
2) Brains make the body act to test a prediction.     <br>
3) Sensory information pass/fails the prediction.     <br>
4) Brains learn by continually cycling thru steps 1- 3.     <br> <br>

The reverse stimulus/response cycle is false:     <br>
1) Sense information. 2) Learn. 3) Respond/React to it.     <br> <br>

Those (active) pushing the wheelchairs learned,     <br>
while the (passive) pushed did not learn anything.     <br> <br>

Predict/Imagine > Act/Test > Sense > Learn!     <br>
NOT Sense > Learn > React     <br> <br>

<br><hr>
7 minutes 29 seconds<br><br>

Sensory Substitution     <br> <br>

The brains of the wheelchair-pushed participants failed     <br>
to adapt to an upside-down world. For example, passive-     <br>
prism-glass wearers’ know logically that dropped balls fall     <br>
down, but their unadapted brains predict that dropped     <br>
balls go up in an upside-down world, and so when first     <br>
allowed to become active, to test, these individuals with     <br>
unadapted brains will reach up to catch dropped balls.     <br> <br>

Brains are not logical, and use the senses <u>not to inform     <br>
themselves,</u> but to test their imaginings/predictions/etc.     <br> <br>

Given that our brains <u>only use our senses</u> to pass/fail     <br>
imagined experiences during active tests, we can make     <br>
the scientific prediction that brains do not need     <br>
eyes to see, ears to hear, etc.!     <br> <br>

<i>     Sensory Substitution Theory     <br>     <br>
	
Brains use sensory organs to test their imagined ideas of      <br>
the world, not to sense (to see, hear, feel, etc.) the world,     <br>
and, so, are able to use one sense to do the job of another.     </i>     <br>     <br>

Sensory Substitution Use — Substitute a sense that is       <br>
not working for one that is = see with your ears!     <br>     <br>

1) Capture information that the lost sense evolved to       <br>
detect with artificial sensors like cameras, for example.       <br>
2) Use a computer to translate the camera’s     <br>
information into patterns that the substituted sensory       <br>
organ can detect: patterns of sound.     <br>
3) Allow the brain to test (pass/fail) its predicted     <br>
patterns of imagined visual experience, against real       <br>
patterns of light translated into patterns of sound.     <br>

Dr. Freeman will now give an example of how      <br>
brains learn to imagine the experience of balance      <br>
and test it against felt patterns of information     <br>
supplied to the tongue by digital balance sensors,      <br>
instead of disease damaged vestibular systems      <br>
(balance sensory systems) located in the inner ears.     <br>      <br>

Brains can learn to substitute information coming      <br>
from the eyes, ears, vestibular (balance) system, etc.     <br>
for patterns of tactile/felt information coming from,      <br>
for example, a wafer on the tongue fed information     <br>
by a computer hooked up to cameras, microphones,      <br>
accelerometers (balance sensors), etc.     <br>     <br>

Brains only create meaning if the stimulus      <br>
(information) coming into the senses     <br>
is significant (rewarding, dangerous, etc.)      <br>
to the organism (human, rabbit, mouse, etc.).     <br>     <br>

One of the most important things that brains do      <br>
is screen out MOST of the information      <br>
coming into the senses. Information that is of      <br>
no significance to the animal.     <br>     <br>

The whole science of neural representation,      <br>
stimulus/response, input/output, etc.     <br>
is disproven     <br>
by the evidence       <br>
of neural dynamics.     <br>      <br>

All that brains can know is what they hypothesize       <br>
and through testing determine       <br>
useful-to-the-organism hypotheses,       <br>
meanings, imaginings, etc.     <br>      <br>

The action-perception theory     <br>
replaces the stimulus-response theory     <br>
as the evidence from neural dynamics shows that       <br>
brains create behavior in response to their own     <br>
hypotheses, meanings, imaginings, etc.     <br>      <br>

Brains do not respond to stimuli coming from reality.     <br>
Brains are solipsistic.     <br>      <br>

Does a test based on the brain’s imagination       <br>
(hypothesis) of reality fail or not fail when tested?     <br>      <br>

The results of such tests are ALL       <br>
that any brain can know       <br>
about the usefulness of its     <br>
imaginings, created meanings,       <br>
self-generated hypothesis, etc.     <br>      <br>

ALL that any brain knows     <br>
is what it has created within itself,       <br>
and how well its creations have tested.     <br>      <br>

Brains are continually engaged in     <br>
1) predicting the future (creating hypotheses),      <br>
2) testing their predictions to determine their      <br>
reliability to successfully guide behavior      <br>
toward reward, away from danger, etc., and then      <br>
3) changing their predictions (hypotheses) as      <br>
required by the results of their tests.     <br>     <br>

The action-perception theory     <br>
is replacing the stimulus-response theory as      <br>
science experiments show that brains create behavior      <br>
(actions) to test their own hypotheses (meanings),      <br>
not to respond to information     <br>
coming into the senses from reality.     <br>     <br>

Brains are dynamical systems     <br>
that do not use a language of any kind.     <br>     <br>

01.33.19     <br>

23:46<br><br>


Brains’ dynamic systems     <br>
(sometimes called chaotic systems) give rise to      <br>
speech (like Dr. Freeman’s), and text (like this text)      <br>
without using a language of any kind to create them     <br>
or to understand them.     <br>     <br>

‘Language’ in this sense is not really a thing at all,      <br>
but rather a set of relationships among a     <br>
1) dynamic system = brain,     <br>
2) behavior = speech and writing,     <br>
3) artifacts = speech sounds and texts, and     <br>
4) senses = eyes, ears, etc.     <br>
By continually cycling thru this set of relationships      <br>
(aka language), the brain tests and refines its ability to     <br>
produce useful language artifacts.      <br>     <br>

We push this fabric out against objects in the world.     <br>
<i>     Brains create behaviors to provoke sensory input.     </i>     <br><br>
The tent’s fabric conforms around these objects.     <br>
<i>     Sensory input pass/fails brains’ ideas, imaginings, etc.     </i>     <br><br>
Thus, we learn what these objects might look like if      <br>
the impenetrable barrier of the tent,     <br>
<i>     the solipsistic isolation of our brains,     </i>     <br><br>
did not separate the fabric encased shapes,     <br>
<i>     did not separate the imagined objects, people, etc,     </i>     <br><br>

The light of meaning comes from within,     <br>
1) creating an array of attractors      <br>
predictions/hypotheses/meanings which the brain     <br>
2) tests by provoking a response from reality,     <br>
an action which results in     <br>
3) energy impacting our senses, and then     <br>
4) hitting one of these attractors, and causing possibly     <br>
an accommodation/change to the attractor or not.      <br>
This prediction, action, perception, accommodation      <br>
cycle builds our knowledge of what is outside the     <br>
impenetrable barrier separating our attractors,      <br>
the brain’s meanings,     <br>
from the energy impacting our senses,     <br>
reality’s information.     <br>      <br>

We know only by imagining     <br>
and doing what we imagine is right,     <br>
not by experiencing and responding to what is real.     <br>     <br>

We are essentially insane: [inˈsān] – in a state of mind      <br>
(in a tent with impenetrable walls)     <br>
that prevents normal perception.     <br>     <br>

But everyone is equal in this their inability     <br>
to experience things as they are,     <br>
to experience only what they imagine, never what is.     <br>     <br>

The first layer of cortex in our ears, eyes, skin, etc.      <br>
puts up attractor landscapes like craters on the      <br>
Moon. Each attractor (crater) is a prediction of what     <br>
patterns of information/energy might hit our senses.      <br>
When a patten of energy hits, what gets transmitted      <br>
to the rest of the brain is which attractor/prediction/      <br>
meaning/etc. has been hit, not the actual pattern, and      <br>
not where or how well the patten hit the attractor.     <br>     <br>

This is easy to see in toddlers, as they have very small      <br>
attractor landscapes. The image of a cat hits their one      <br>
attractor for four-legged animals; it spirals to the      <br>
bottom, and the toddler points, and says, “dog!”     <br>
Brains can only experience what they create (dog),      <br>
not what the senses sense (cat). 1:45:16     <br>

Everyone is equal in their inability     <br>
to experience things as they are,     <br>
to experience only what they imagine, never what is.      <br>
So how do we share knowledge?     <br>     <br>

We share knowledge when predicting,      <br>
acting/testing, sensing, and accommodating together,      <br>
thus causing our brains to generate     <br>
similar meanings. The more action required     <br>
in our relating to each other     <br>
(dancing versus watching TV together)     <br>
the more similar and useful will grow     <br>
our meanings, our “shared” knowledge,     <br>
our imagined experiences of what is real.     <br>     <br>

01:50:40     <br>

Our excess focus on individual achievement is a      <br>
denial of our brains’ core need to have others      <br>
actively participate in our lives (act with us)     <br>
rather than watch and judge us.      <br>
We need others to practice with us,      <br>
not preach at us.     <br>     <br>

Brains are social organs.     <br>     <br>

We “share” knowledge ONLY when predicting,      <br>
acting/testing, sensing, and accommodating <u> together </u> ,      <br>
causing our brains to generate similar meanings.      <br>
Failure to act together (to preach, but not practice)     <br>
isolates us from each other, making us feel apart,     <br>
even when we are together.     <br>     <br>

Brains create new categories/attractors/meanings/etc.       <br>
in response to A) failures by their existing attractors       <br>
that B) also demand attention = “Learn this!”     <br>
1) An energy pattern failing to fit any existing attractor,       <br>
2) falls into a waste-basket attractor, which 3) if the       <br>
orienting response is also triggered, 4) causes the       <br>
brain to grow a new attractor = learn, <U> but only if </U>     <br>
5) the brain can test the new attractor.     <br>      <br>

For example, dogs' orienting responses may be       <br>
triggered for unknown words, "Learn this!" But,       <br>
unable to test words, to speak, most words heard       <br>
will never make it out of dogs’ waste-basket attractors.     <br>
The inability to push their vocabulary wheelchairs, to       <br>
speak, limits the size of word-attractor arrays for dogs.     <br>      <br>

To facilitate new learning you must open up your      <br>
mind. Perhaps one way to do this is to move     <br>
in a novel way, and in so doing force your     <br>
brain into creating new attractors, meanings,      <br>
predictions, etc. to handle the novel movements that      <br>
you are asking it to make, and that at first, using its      <br>
existing attractors, it will fail to do. Repeated practice      <br>
of the novel movements, will continually create      <br>
new attractors until the movements are     <br>
easily handled by the brain. Forcing the brain to focus      <br>
on new experiences increases the overall plasticity of      <br>
the brain to learn anything as noted in the book      <br>
The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge     <br>
(2007 New York:Viking, pages 85-87).     <br>     <br>

The difference between learning that A) we already      <br>
know something and B) we don’t know something,      <br>
is a cyclical process of repeated, focused failures.     <br>     <br>

1) Invoke the orienting response to concentrate     <br>
all available brain power on the     <br>
2) predict/imagine > act/test > sense > learn cycle.      <br>
3) The object/event/etc. focused upon must continually     <br>
overcome capture by any existing attractor,      <br>
predictions, imaginings put up by the brain.      <br>
4) Only after repeated, focused failure cycles to      <br>
predict/imagine > act/test > sense > learn     <br>
will the brain generate a new attractor, prediction,      <br>
imagining and thus begin to learn something new!     <br>     <br>

The brain has to orient, focus, and fail to predict a      <br>
novel stimulus to create a new attractor,      <br>
hypothesis, category, meaning, etc.     <br>
The brains’ of the natives imagined distant ships to be      <br>
low clouds, because the images of distant ships on      <br>
their retinas were not rejected by their cloud      <br>
attractors. But, as the ships got closer, their cloud     <br>
attractors did reject the images of ships and crews ...      <br>
“Hey, those are NOT clouds!”     <br>
We don’t see ships or clouds. We imagine them.      <br>
One way to get our brains to imagine better is to pay      <br>
closer and closer attention,“...NOT clouds!” to fail      <br>
how our brains imagine, predict, categorize, etc.     <br>

Act/Test!     <br>
Drive in life’s traffic using your brain’s      <br>
manufactured experience and figure out ways to test it,     <br>
to flip the input coming into your senses,     <br>
to challenge your balance with novel movements,      <br>
to pay closer attention,     <br>
to force your brain to learn,     <br>
to accommodate,     <br>
to empathize,     <br>
to dance without stepping on other’s toes!     <br>

In Dr. Freeman's 1996 *editorial      <br>
"Happiness Doesn't Come in Bottles:      <br>
Neuroscientists learn that joy comes through dancing,     <br>
not drugs," he writes ...     <br>     <br>

“ Where we humans find joy is in surmounting [the]     <br>
solipsistic barrier between us     <br>
and sharing our feelings and comforts.     <br>
We cannot ever really cross it, but, a bit like      <br>
neighbors chatting over a fence, we can be together.     <br>
However, there is more to this communion      <br>
than mere talking.There is trust, which underlies      <br>
true friendships and partnerships.      <br>
...Trust comes when we are able to predict      <br>
what other people will do, and we achieve that     <br>
by repeated cooperative actions.     <br>
...We create our own joys,     <br>
and we feel happiest in learning to trust each other. ”     <br>     <br>

I hope this remix and my notes where helpful to you!     <br>
Push these ideas around for yourself. Present them      <br>
using your words, images, skits, dances, music, etc.      <br>
They are very strange, but also very humane, which I     <br>
learned remixing the original video to create this one!     <br>     <br>

The YouTube description has links to the full talk,      <br>
and to more talks and papers by Dr. Freeman      <br>
and other scientists investigating the     <br>
ideas presented in this video.     <br>
